If you’re using a tool like nodemon, 
it will automatically restart the server
whenever it 
detects changes in your files. 
To use nodemon, 
you can install it globally 
or as a dev dependency:

npm install -g nodemon

npm install --save-dev nodemon
Then you can start your server with nodemon:

nodemon server.js
This way, you don't have to manually
restart the server every time you make
changes to your code.

Middleware in Express is a function 
that processes incoming requests before they 
reach the route handlers. 
In this context, the middleware express.json() 
is used to automatically parse JSON data in 
the request body. 
This means that when a request with JSON data 
is received, express.json() 
converts the JSON into a JavaScript 
object, making it accessible through req.body 
in your route handlers. 
This simplifies handling data 
sent from the client.

4.>In simpler terms, req.body in a Node.js and Express application represents the data sent by the client 
(such as a web browser or a mobile app) in the body of an HTTP request. 
This data is usually sent when submitting a form or making an API call with methods like POST, PUT, or PATCH.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Client-Side: When you submit a form on a website or send data via an API request, this data is included in the body of the HTTP request. 
This could be user input like login details, signup information, or any other data that needs to be sent to the server.

Server-Side: On the server, Express.js handles this incoming request. The express.json() middleware 
(which you included with app.use(express.json()) in your server.js file) parses the JSON data in the request body and makes it available under req.body.



5.>The React Virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. 
This process is called reconciliation.


6.>
React Virtual DOM Process
Initial Render:

When the Signup component is first rendered, React creates a virtual representation of the component tree.
This virtual DOM is then used to generate the actual DOM elements and insert them into the browser's DOM.
State Change:

When the state (e.g., email or password) changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree.
React compares the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one to determine what has changed. This process is known as "diffing."
Reconciliation:

React identifies the differences between the previous and the new virtual DOM trees.
Only the parts of the actual DOM that need to be updated are changed, instead of re-rendering the entire DOM.



7.>Understanding JSON Parsing Middleware
Incoming Request:

When a client (like a web browser or a mobile app) sends a request to your server, the data in the request body can be in various formats, including JSON.
JSON Payload:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for sending data in web applications. It is lightweight and easy to read/write for both humans and machines.
Middleware Function:

In Express.js, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
Parsing JSON:

When the express.json() middleware is used, it parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the resulting data available on req.body.


8.> JWT way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
Authentication:

When a user logs in, the server creates a JWT, which contains the user's information (like their ID). This token is then sent back to the user's browser.
The user's browser stores this token (usually in local storage or a cookie) and sends it with every request to the server.
The server checks the token to verify the user's identity and grant access to protected resources without needing to re-authenticate the user every timE.
